# Western Governor's University Masters of Science in Data Analytics

Hi, this repo contains my projects and papers I've worked on throughout my time at Western Governor's University. It shows off the skills I have developed and that I currently utilize in my career through actual data work. 

# Classes
The following classes are included in this repository:

## Data Analytics

### Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning continues building proficiency in the data analytics life cycle with data preparation skills. This course
addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Learners write code to manipulate,
structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets.
This course covers the following competencies:
- The graduate predicts potential obstacles in data analysis based on the quality of data provided.
- The graduate prepares data for analysis to address organizational needs.
- The graduate writes reusable code to manipulate and clean data in preparation for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis covers statistical principles supporting the data analytics life cycle. Students in this course
compute and interpret measures of central tendency, correlations, and variation. The course introduces hypothesis testing,
focusing on application for parametric tests, and addresses communication skills and tools to explain an analyst’s findings to
others within an organization.
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate interprets central tendency, correlations, and variation to inform organizational decisions.
● The graduate conducts parametric hypothesis testing

### Predictive Modeling
Predictive Modeling builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling students to make assertions vital to
organizational needs. In this course, students conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena
revealed by data. The course covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing students to communicate findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders. 
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate employs logistic regression algorithms to describe phenomena.
● The graduate employs multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing
phenomena.
● The graduate makes assertions based on regression modeling.

### Advanced Data Analytics
Advanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides
emerging concepts in data analysis. This course hones the mental and theoretical flexibility that will be required of analysts
in the coming decades while grounding their approach firmly in ethical and organizational-need-focused practice. Topics
include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources.
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.
● The graduate applies time series models in generating forecasts.
● The graduate extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models. 

## Data Management

### Data Acquisition
Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle.
The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation.
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
● The graduate implements physical data models.
● The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis. 

### Advanced Data Acquisition 
Advanced Data Acquisition enhances theoretical and SQL skills in furthering the data analytics life cycle. This course  covers advanced SQL operations, 
aggregating data, and acquiring data from various sources in support of core  organizational needs. The prerequisite for this course is Representation and Reporting.
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate applies advanced SQL operations to integrate multiple data sources.
● The graduate explores data acquisition. 

## Data Mining

### Data Mining I
Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the
data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data
mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The
course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity.
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate applies observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
● The graduate implements prediction data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.
● The graduate evaluates data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.

###  Data Mining II 
Data Mining II adds vital tools to data analytics arsenal that incorporates unsupervised models. This course explains when,  how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs.
This course covers the following competencies: 
● The graduate applies clustering techniques to accurately predict outcomes of interest. 
● The graduate implements dimension reduction methods to identify significant variables. 
● The graduate predicts patterns in data using association rules and lift analysis.  

## Data Visualization

### Representation and Reporting
Representation and Reporting focuses on communicating observations and patterns to diverse stakeholders, a key aspect
of the data analytics life cycle. This course helps students gain communication and storytelling skills. It also covers data
visualizations, audio representations, and interactive dashboards.
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate communicates data insights to technical and nontechnical audiences.
● The graduate creates data representations to offer insight into an organizational problem. 
● The graduate designs executive decision support with interactive tools. 

## Capstone

### Data Analytics Graduate Capstone
The Data Analytics Graduate Capstone allows students to apply the academic and professional abilities developed as a
graduate student. This capstone challenges students to integrate skills and knowledge from several program domains into
one project.
This course covers the following competencies:
● The graduate integrates and synthesizes competencies from across the degree program, thereby demonstrating the
ability to participate in and contribute value to the chosen professional field.
