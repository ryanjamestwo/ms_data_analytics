    "The research question that I want to ask for this task is \"What factors contribute most to whether or not a customer will churn?\". I did a similar analysis in my D208 assessment task 2. This is a useful analysis to explore because it helps us understand what customer factors may possibly affect what causes a customer to be a customer that churns and a customer that doesn't. It can also help with planning for the future, to see if there will be more or less customers that are churning."

    "The goal is to determine which factors are most significantly correlated to the variable of churn. In order to determine this, I am going to use scikitlearn and the K nearest neighbors method in order. This will leave us with a set of variables that are related to churn and those that are not. From these list of variables that are relevant, we can then begin to make interpretations about the data and how it can be used to affect churn in a way that is beneficial to the business."
